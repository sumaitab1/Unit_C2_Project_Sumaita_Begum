<h1> Headings and Paragraphs </h1>

<p> <ol> 
    <li> Headings are used to create an outline structure on a web page. There are only </b> 6 </b> heading types from h1-h6. For a heading tag we use: &lth#&gt;
<li> Paragraphs tags are the workhorse tag of web designs. Most blocks of text use paragraphs for their formatting so remembering this tag is crucial. For a paragraph tag we use &ltp&gt;. However, if you would like to include a line break use the tag &ltbr&gt; to start a line break.
  <li> If you would like a line between the tags use the tag &lthr&gt; which is basically just an empty tag. If you would like to preserve multiple spaces or line breaks you can use the preformatted text &ltpre&gt; tag. This tag is a <b> block level element </b>
